# Repo for the Mod the dotnet-bot wesbite
## Create your own coding companion

Coding is better with friends, especially when they bring their own mods. As the mascot for the .NET community, dotnet-bot helps with checking pull requests on .NET repos on GitHub. This repo is the source for creating your own custom coding companion by modding the dotnet-bot. 

If you found a bug or want to request new parts for the bot, submit an issue!
